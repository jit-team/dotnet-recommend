MovieLens test data
-------------------

MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project
at the University of Minnesota.
 
This data set consists of:
	* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
	* Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
        * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)

The data was collected through the MovieLens web site
(movielens.umn.edu) during the seven-month period from September 19th, 
1997 through April 22nd, 1998. This data has been cleaned up - users
who had less than 20 ratings or did not have complete demographic
information were removed from this data set. Detailed descriptions of
the data file can be found at the end of this file.

Neither the University of Minnesota nor any of the researchers
involved can guarantee the correctness of the data, its suitability
for any particular purpose, or the validity of results based on the
use of the data set.  The data set may be used for any research
purposes under the following conditions:

     * The user may not state or imply any endorsement from the
       University of Minnesota or the GroupLens Research Group.

     * The user must acknowledge the use of the data set in
       publications resulting from the use of the data set, and must
       send us an electronic or paper copy of those publications.

     * The user may not redistribute the data without separate
       permission.

     * The user may not use this information for any commercial or
       revenue-bearing purposes without first obtaining permission
       from a faculty member of the GroupLens Research Project at the
       University of Minnesota.
